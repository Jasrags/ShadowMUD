\a sharp female voice with a German accent/[8 MHz, English]: Good evening.

The Colt M-23 is a stripped down version of the M22A2.  It can accept all
standard accessories.

There is a top-mounted smartlink-2 accessory attached to the top of it.
There is an improved gas vent IV attached to the barrel of it.
There is a foregrip attached to the underside of it.
It contains 38 rounds of normal ammunition, and can hold 40 rounds.
You have no training in Police Procedures, but you guess that a Colt M-23 is highly illegal.
A Colt M-23 is in excellent condition.
