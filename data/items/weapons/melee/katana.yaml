name: katana
description: The legendary two-handed sword of the samurai. The katana has become synonymous not just with street samurai, but with shadowrunners in general, at least in the trids; they’ve got everyone packing a katana, from the decker to the mage. But being a silly cliché doesn’t make this blade any less dangerous, or less helpful in a fight.
