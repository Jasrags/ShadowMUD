name: Combat Axe
description: A two-handed tungsten-alloy monster, available single- or double-bladed. A hardened thrusting point can be concealed, spring-loaded, in the handle. While it may seem barbaric or primitive, the physical augmentations of 2075 can make an old-school weapon like a combat axe even deadlier than a firearm in the right hands. So go ahead, go medieval.
